This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift functions when mixing integer (Int) and floating-point (Double) number parameters.  The compiler gets confused due to implicit type conversions, leading to the error "ambiguous use of operator '*'" when performing calculations. The solution shows how to resolve this issue by explicitly specifying the types or converting them consistently.
